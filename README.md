AngularJSSamples
================

This is a collection of code samples I am creating for my "Front End JavaScript WITH AngularJS ..." talk.

In this talk we will start with the basics of AngularsJS, look at the databinding model directives and using templates. We will quickly build an advanced HTML application using controllers and routes. Coming out of this session you will be able to build some pretty cool applications using AngularJS using surprinsingly little code, you will have an understanding of how AngularJS incorporates the basic principles behind the original MVC software design pattern, and you will have seen some more advanced capabilities of my now favorite JavaScript framework.

Here are the examples so far:

* 01-ngmodel - most basic example
* 02-ngrepeat - demonstrate ng-repeat
* 03-ngrepeat - ng-repeat with "richer" data
* 04-ngrepeat-search - ngrepeat with filter


Todo:

- add mini shopping cart to ngrepeat example
- http://angular-ui.github.com
- ... way more...go through custom filters, routes, template, injection, resources, ....
